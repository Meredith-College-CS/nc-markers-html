<h1 id="welcome">Welcome to North Carolina Historical Markers! </h1>
<div class="home-paragraphs">
<p id="p-home" style="font-size: 17px; ">Thank you for your interest in the North Carolina Highway Historical Marker program. 
    Since 1935, the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources and 
    the Department of Transportation have operated this program jointly
    to share concise accounts of our state's history. Ours is one of the oldest 
    such programs in continuous operation in the United States.
    Currently the system features over 1600 markers statewide—in silver and black, with brief sentences in large font, emblazoned with 
    the state seal—covering a broad swath of topics. In every county, these labels on the landscape point to places associated with 
    people or events significant in our history.
    The markers are designed to spark interest, to encourage a deeper exploration, and to tie an observer, however briefly, to the past.
    Unlike monuments, markers do not seek to glorify or celebrate people and events. Instead, they aim to highlight objective facts of 
    our state’s past. Markers make note of all parts of North Carolina history— the good and the bad, the reprehensible along with the 
    laudable, the tragic and the heroic, all in an effort to educate North Carolinians about our shared history. </p>

    into this fascinating historical resource. Our website offers intuitive navigation options for an optimal user experience. The navigation bar presents a 
    range of options for seamless site exploration. The "Home" navigation button facilitates easy navigation back to the current page. 
    The "Search" button provides access to our search engines, enabling users to search for markers using keywords, county names, 
    city names, or marker ID and title. The "About" navigation button provides insights into the development team of the website.</p>
